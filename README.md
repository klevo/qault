# qault

Personal, post quantum safe key-chain / password manager / secrets vault written in Go.

Command line interface inspired by [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/).

## Motivation

I want a simple replacement for the cloud based, big corp tools, like Google or Apple password managers. I'd like to be able to recover access to all my digital services, even in case I loose all my devices, by just remembering a master password and having access to a remote Git repository. While at it, let's make the storage/encryption post-quantum safe. 

## Goals

* Command line interface following simple UNIX philosophy.
* Unlock using a master password.
* Future proofed by utilizing post-quantum cryptography from Go's standard library.
* Hardened for production use.
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) integration, for remote storage and synchronization between multiple machines.

## Design

* Secrets, together with their metadata, are stored as encrypted JSON files in the data directory. The filename is a UUID v7 generated by `github.com/google/uuid` package.
* Data directory lives under `$XDG_DATA_HOME/qault` if present on the system, otherwise `$HOME/.qault`.
* For password based key derivation use [Argon2id](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/crypto/argon2#hdr-Argon2id) with a reasonably high memory cost and time cost, and a parallelism parameter tuned to the user’s CPU.

## CLI examples

### Initialization

To create the data storage directory, if it doesn't exist already:

```sh
qault init
```

Outputs the location of the data directory and 0 exit code if directory was created or already exists, otherwise 1.

### Adding secrets to the vault

```sh
qault add Amazon.com 
```

Asks for the secret to store using secure input. If input is empty, asks again.

After non-empty input is received, ask for master password to encrypt with.
