# qault

Post quantum cryptography key-chain / password manager / secrets vault written in Go.

Command line interface inspired by [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/).

## Goals

* Unlock using a master password.
* Future proofed by utilizing post-quantum cryptography from Go's standard library.

## Design

* Secrets, together with their metadata, are stored as encrypted files in the data directory. The filename is a UUID v7 generated by `github.com/google/uuid` package.
* Data directory lives under `$XDG_DATA_HOME/qault` if present on the system, otherwise `$HOME/.qault`.
